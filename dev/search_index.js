This means clients with that protocol level need to be able to asynchronously handle INFO messages.\n\nserver_id::String: The unique identifier of the NATS server.\nserver_name::String: The name of the NATS server.\nversion::String: The version of NATS.\ngo::String: The version of golang the NATS server was built with.\nhost::String: The IP address used to start the NATS server, by default this will be 0.0.0.0 and can be configured with -client_advertise host:port.\nport::Int64: The port number the NATS server is configured to listen on.\nheaders::Bool: Whether the server supports headers.\nmax_payload::Int64: Maximum payload size, in bytes, that the server will accept from the client.\nproto::Int64: An integer indicating the protocol version of the server. The server version 1.2.0 sets this to 1 to indicate that it supports the \"Echo\" feature.\nclient_id::Union{Nothing, UInt64}: The internal client identifier in the server. This can be used to filter client connections in monitoring, correlate with error logs, etc...\nauth_required::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, then the client should try to authenticate upon connect.\ntls_required::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, then the client must perform the TLS/1.2 handshake.
