When using the updated client protocol (see CONNECT below), INFO messages can be sent anytime by the server. This means clients with that protocol level need to be able to asynchronously handle INFO messages.\n\nserver_id::String: The unique identifier of the NATS server.\nserver_name::String: The name of the NATS server.\nversion::String: The version of NATS.\ngo::String: The version of golang the NATS server was built with.\nhost::String: The IP address used to start the NATS server, by default this will be 0.0.0.0 and can be configured with -client_advertise host:port.\nport::Int64: The port number the NATS server is configured to listen on.\nheaders::Bool: Whether the server supports headers.\nmax_payload::Int64: Maximum payload size, in bytes, that the server will accept from the client.\nproto::Int64: An integer indicating the protocol version of the server. The server version 1.2.0 sets this to 1 to indicate that it supports the \"Echo\" feature.\nclient_id::Union{Nothing, UInt64}: The internal client identifier in the server. This can be used to filter client connections in monitoring, correlate with error logs, etc...\nauth_required::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, then the client should try to authenticate upon connect.\ntls_required::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, then the client must perform the TLS/1.2 handshake. Note, this used to be ssl_required and has been updated along with the protocol from SSL to TLS.\ntls_verify::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, the client must provide a valid certificate during the TLS handshake.\ntls_available::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If this is true, the client can provide a valid certificate during the TLS handshake.\nconnect_urls::Union{Nothing, Vector{String}}: List of server urls that a client can connect to.\nws_connect_urls::Union{Nothing, Vector{String}}: List of server urls that a websocket client can connect to.\nldm::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If the server supports Lame Duck Mode notifications, and the current server has transitioned to lame duck, ldm will be set to true.\ngit_commit::Union{Nothing, String}: The git hash at which the NATS server was built.\njetstream::Union{Nothing, Bool}: Whether the server supports JetStream.\nip::Union{Nothing, String}: The IP of the server.\nclient_ip::Union{Nothing, String}: The IP of the client.\nnonce::Union{Nothing, String}: The nonce for use in CONNECT.\ncluster::Union{Nothing, String}: The name of the cluster.\ndomain::Union{Nothing, String}: The configured NATS domain of the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"protocol/#NATS.Connect","page":"Protocol messages","title":"NATS.Connect","text":"The CONNECT message is the client version of the INFO message.

Sending 1 indicates that the client supports dynamic reconfiguration of cluster topology changes by asynchronously receiving INFO messages with known servers it can reconnect to.\necho::Union{Nothing, Bool}: If set to false, the server (version 1.2.0+) will not send originating messages from this connection to its own subscriptions. Clients should set this to false only for server supporting this feature, which is when proto in the INFO protocol is set to at least 1.\nsig::Union{Nothing, String}: In case the server has responded with a nonce on INFO, then a NATS client must use this field to reply with the signed nonce.\njwt::Union{Nothing, String}: The JWT that identifies a user permissions and account.\nno_responders::Union{Nothing, Bool}: Enable quick replies for cases where a request is sent to a topic with no responders.\nheaders::Union{Nothing, Bool}: Whether the client supports headers.\nnkey::Union{Nothing, String}: The public NKey to authenticate the client.
